# Cyber Bullying Detection

This project investigates two core approaches to cyberbullying detection:

- **Text-based detection** using BERT (base and fine-tuned)
- **Image-based detection** using VGG16 (base and fine-tuned)

Each approach is implemented in a dedicated notebook, demonstrating the process of starting with a pre-trained model and then fine-tuning it for improved performance on cyberbullying data.
